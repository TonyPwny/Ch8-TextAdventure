/**
 * Modification of "World of Zuul" application
 * 
 * Modified to simulate waking up in your apartment late for work.
 * You must find your keys and your way out to your car.
 * If you don't have your keys upon leaving the apartment, you
 * may get yourself locked out and with no way to get to work.

 *  This class is the main class of the "World of Zuul" application. 
 *  "World of Zuul" is a very simple, text based adventure game.  Users 
 *  can walk around some scenery. That's all. It should really be extended 
 *  to make it more interesting!
 * 
 *  To play this game, create an instance of this class and call the "play"
 *  method.
 * 
 *  This main class creates and initialises all the others: it creates all
 *  rooms, creates the parser and starts the game.  It also evaluates and
 *  executes the commands that the parser returns.
